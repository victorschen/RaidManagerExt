                      <td> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RAID is an acronym for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. It 
is an array of multiple independent hard disk drives that provides 
high performance and fault tolerance. The SATA RAID controller 
implements several levels of the Berkeley RAID technology. An 
appropriate RAID level is selected when the volume sets are 
disk capacity, data availability (fault tolerance or redundancy), 
and disk performance. The following section discusses the RAID 
levels supported by the SATA RAID controller.
The SATA RAID controller makes the RAID implementation and 
the disk's physical configuration transparent to the host operating
system. This means that the host operating system drivers and 
software utilities are not affected, regardless of the RAID level 
selected. Correct installation of the disk array and the controller 
requires a proper understanding of RAID technology and the 
concepts.

multiple disk drives instead of just one disk drive. RAID 0 does 
not provide any data redundancy, but does offer the best high-speed 
data throughput. RAID 0 breaks up data into smaller blocks 
and then writes a block to each drive in the array. Disk striping 
enhances performance because multiple drives are accessed 
simultaneously; the reliability of RAID Level 0 is less because the 
entire array will fail if any one disk drive fails, due to a lack of 
redundancy.</td>

drive is simultaneously written to another disk drive. Read per-
formance may be enhanced if the array controller can, in parallel, 
accesses both members of a mirrored pair. During writes, there 
will be a minor performance penalty when compared to writing 
to a single disk. If one drive fails, all data (and software applica-
tions) are preserved on the other drive. RAID 1 offers extremely 
high data reliability, but at the cost of doubling the required data 
storage capacity.                      </td>

odd number of disks as well. </td>

RAID 5, the parity information is written to all of the drives in the 
controllers rather than being concentrated on a dedicated parity 
disk. If one drive in the system fails, the parity information can 
be used to reconstruct the data from that drive. All drives in the 
array system can be used for seek operations at the same time, 
greatly increasing the performance of the RAID system. This 
relieves the write bottleneck that characterizes RAID 4, and is the 
primary reason that RAID 5 is more often implemented in RAID 
arrays.</td>
